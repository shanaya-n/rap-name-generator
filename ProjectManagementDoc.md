## Project Management Document

> Meeting #1: Feb. 6, 2020

During this meeting, we did background research about what modification/addition we wanted to make for our semester project. We decided on adding an additional output to the "finger" command in the terminal. In addition to the current outputs, we will also provide the terminal user with their rapper name. The rapper name will be based on the first letter of their first name and the first letter of their last name. In the event that the user doesn't have their first and last name inputted into their terminal, we will comprise the name based off the first letter of their first name and the last letter of their last name.
