CMSI 387 Operating Systems
   Semester Project
===================================

This should be a fun and interesting project!  I think the
finger utility will be very instructive for you to modify, since
it also has networking things built into it.  I like the idea of
using the users' phone numbers and birth months as a basis for
the encoding of the rapper name!

Project approved.  Good work and good luck!
